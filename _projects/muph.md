This is my first ever Game Jam entry made for **GMTK Game Jam 2023**

In this adventure you play as the talking sword, you can't do much but press critical hit button as your wielder swings you to do additional damage at a cost, you can also annoy your hero to the end. Try to not break to survive to the end.
