## Abilities
Can stop time at will for however long, but can't manipulate objects at all besides special material made from ytempo gems. So no throwing infinite knives nor being able to move in normal clothes at all.

## Relationships
### [Cinnamon](/ocs/cinnamon) & [Anise](/ocs/anise)
Absolutely hates both of them and devotes life to taking them down.
### [Devanna](/ocs/devanna)
Can relate to Devannaâ€™s issues and quickly becomes teammates with them.
### [Cardamon](/ocs/cardamon)
Feels bad for her but gave up on trying to "fix" her
