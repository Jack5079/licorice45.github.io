After being hit by the ytempo corruption, besides getting a new ability, Peppercorn lost everything and now is at odds with other more succesful corrupted humans.
## Abilities
Can stop time at will for however long, but can't manipulate objects at all besides special material made from ytempo gems. So no throwing infinite knives nor being able to move in normal clothes at all.
